# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on custom CSS, fooled around with Sass and HTML

**Thoughts:** Remembering the good ole days of Myspace CSS, *ahem*


### Day 1: Jan 2nd 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Made some responsive landing pages, looked at Bootstrap, went back to custom CSS

**Thoughts**: I like things to be harder, dont' know why, but Bootstrap made me feel like a villain.



### Day 2: Jan 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to focus on the full-stack web developer course today, brushed on on my HTML and CSS knowledge... again.  

**Thoughts** Floating, flex-boxing, gridding... it's all relative, really.  But I prefer grids.  



### Day 3: Jan 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More of the Udemy Web developer course.  I realized I bought two... one with Rob, one with Colt.  Double-learning day.  Two pages built.  

**Thoughts** I enjoy messing around with CSS properties, still not interested in Bootstrap.  



### Day 4: Jan 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from both courses, focused on CS:50 - the basics.  

**Thoughts** Before delving into JS, I figured it would would be best to get a refresher on computer science.  Got two videos in, enjoyed it immensely. 



### Day 5: Jan 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched more CS50, learned something new today about the web.  

**Thoughts** Thought I knew all there was to know from all my years hacking away on computers as a youngling... BUT I was wrong!  Or I forgot.  Anyway, I'm enjoying these videos and also feeling as if I've missed out on way too much since messing around with ASP 12 years ago!



### Day 6: Jan 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CS:50, dabbling with Python today.  

**Thoughts** Seriously considering Python over JS, but it seems as if they work well together, so I'll stick with JS as my main language and branch out to Python when I've fully understood JS.



### Day 7: Jan 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through 3 lessons of a Watch and Code course linked off Hack Reactor's site, looked at other prep work.  

**Thoughts** Really into this course, but do feel as if I'll forget all of what I've learned here.  I do understand it though, that is what matters right now.



### Day 8: Jan 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Watch and Code.  Up to version 4 of this Todos web app.    

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying everything I'm learning here, though I don't think I like loops too much.  Functions, arrays, objects and methods are all a go.



### Day 9: Jan 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Up to Version 8 of the todos app.  Did some background reading on JS as well.  

**Thoughts** I'm halfway sure I know what is going on.  I don't have a question mark going on, so that is good or I am so lost that I don't know if I don't grasp what I'm doing here.  I think I'll be going through this W&C again.



### Day 10: Jan 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the todos app!~  

**Thoughts** It's done, finally!  I was impatient with getting that finished.  The code looks clean, concise, and confusing.  But only at first glance, once I get a better look at what's going on through the DOM, it becomes clearer.  This is only the beginning though, the basics.  Loops are my kryptonite right now, so I'll unfortunately need to focus on those FOR a WHILE.  



### Day 11: Jan 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through the first and second chapters of Udacity's Intro to JS. Did a code-along video making a rock, paper, scissors game using JS using my own snazzy CSS skills.   

**Thoughts** After the Watch and Code, this is definitely feeling easy and I am able to finish problems easily.  The rock-paper-scissors page was a lot of fun to build.



### Day 12: Jan 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: All the way up to the half-way mark on Arrays now in the Intro to JS course.   

**Thoughts** I've had some stumbling blocks with a few of the problem sets, mostly with me overthinking the solution and adding in too many variables or extra bits of unnecessary code.  I'm finding that I usually am close to being correct the first try, then once I run test and get a negative, I try a completely different route and get way off the mark.  Thinking I should definitely attempt to NOT do that.  However, it is a good feeling knowing that I tend to be very close to the correct answer on problems that I get wrong.   



### Day 13: Jan 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intro to JS.    

**Thoughts** Only struggled with one or two problems - again, overthinking and overcompensating when solutions were rather simple.  It's not that complicated.  I think I want it to be complicated because I've seen algorithms....  



### Day 14: Jan 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Officially started the 100 days of code, although I technically started it Jan 1st (or more accurately, Dec. 27th of 2017).  Did the whole Bootstrap section on Freecodecamp.  Looked at some jQuery.  

**Thoughts** Bootstrap isn't that bad, it definitely has its pros when it comes down to being quick and efficient.  jQuery also seems decent.  I like that I can incorporate css in it.  Animations are fun, especially thinking of using unhinged on a personal project. 



### Day 15: Jan 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished jQuery section on FCC, starting the Tribute page. 

**Thoughts** Although I've made several pages before, this is daunting to me because I'm not used to avoiding custom CSS.  My tendency is to want to start up an external style sheet to achieve everything shown in the example, but I'm attempting to rely on Bootstrap and jQuery tricks to achieve a decent page.
